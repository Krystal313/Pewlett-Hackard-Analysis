* The analysis also showed that 2 managers positions may remain as vacant until someone become eligible to the mentorship program. However, given there are only 2 managers retiring, this will be the least concern. 

* Given the eligible employees can only filled approximately 2.1% of the retiring positions, this mentorship program still cannot resolves the issue of vacant positions.
